# ðŸ™‰ ChoreChamp

[My Notes](notes.md)

This web application will be a calendar with weekly to-do lists. The weekly to-do lists will be used to create chores and will have a scoreboard and calculator for allowances. Admins create the to-do list and add objectives thereto. Admins are able to add viewers(users that cannot edit list but can request task completion). Admins can score tasks completed by users, giving points to the users, which will be referenced later when calculating allowance at the end of the week.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Design

![Design image](startup_design.png)

Here is a diagram that shows administrators would interact with the website in order to set up tasks and score tasks, and how viewers are able to accept and complete tasks.

    Website -->>Child: Task added
    Child->>Website: Task completed

```

### Key features

- Scoreboard for all users updated in real-time
- Allowance is calculated in real-time and locked at the end of the week

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML will structure the web application's user interface: the layout of the weekly calendar, to-do list items, task completion forms, user login/register forms, and the scoreboard.
- **CSS** - CSS will style the calendar, weekly to-do list, color the tasks based on completion (green = finished, yellow = pending approval, gray = needing completion), and design the scoreboard.
- **React** - React will take care of the login, live task updates, scoreboard updates, and allowance updates. It will also allow admins and viewers to see previous months/weeks.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for login, retrieving tasks(viewers), submitting tasks for approval (viewers), retrieving pending tasks (admins), retrieving scoreboard updates, and retrieving end-of-week allowances.
- **DB/Login** - Store admins and viewers, tasks, pending approval tasks, and completed tasks in database. Register and login for users.
- **WebSocket** - Takes care of updating website whenever a change is made, i.e. new task, pending approval task, task completion, scoreboard update, allowance finalized.
